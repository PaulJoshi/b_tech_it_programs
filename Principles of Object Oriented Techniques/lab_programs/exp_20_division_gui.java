/* Develop a program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The user
enters two numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num2 is
displayed in the Result field when the Divide button is clicked. If Num1 or Num2 were not
an integer, the program would throw a NumberFormatException. If Num2 were Zero, the program
would throw an Arithmetic Exception Display the exception in a message dialog box */
