So dissatisfied on the service otherwise the place is nice.'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  Love the concept? Food presentation is awesome. Good place to hangout- another brewery to list. Their beer is good and worth trying all their samples. Food menu is well curated to go along with beer and other drinks. Ordered juicy lucy meatballs, piri piri chicken and shrimp salad. My fav was the meatballs- packed with flavour. Piri piri chicken was tasty and had enough heat to go well with the beer. Shrimp salad was a let down - prawn was used and not shrimp. Prawn was a bit over cooked.\n\nOverall a lovely place to head to in jp nagar.'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\n  Nice ambience, good food and great beers. Being a new outlet, lot of improvements and focus is needed on the service front. I celebrated my birthday today, so happy and have good memories to take forward - except the cake which was really watery and tasted below average ?. All the best guys and I am sure over the days/weeks to come, you will turn things around.')]","[]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

A little bit too oily, no doubt. But it hit all the right notes!\n\nI also tried the uluvacharu Kodi pulao.. the biriyani was definitely good but nothing extraordinary.

The way the atmosphere they have maintained is beautiful and the Manager. Suresh was excellent at the service he suggested us the best spicy biryani - Gadwal Kodi Pulao and we ordered it and damn yummmmmy!!

Chapala Vepudu was crispy and good.\n\nMain course we took Roti along Andhra Kodi curry which was spicy and had fine taste. Gadwal Kodi pulao was good in taste.

Right spice levels + good quality boneless meat + flavourful rice make it quite a good choice, a lot different from the ubiquitous Andhra biriyani.\nThey have some good side dishes as well, though most of them seem to be available only in the evenings. We tried the Liver Roast and it was very good.'), ('Rated 3.0', 'RATED\n  Was waiting to try this after hearing a lot from tamil nadu about it . But the taste is average .

We were asked to wait for 10 mins and trust me it was worth the wait. We sat down and the seats were comfortable. Although its a busy place but no one will bother you. Kudos to the staff for getting everything on time, you just need to ask them once. I ordered 2 chicken boneless biryani and it was good. It would be great to come here during the day and try out their thali once.'), ('Rated 2.0', ""RATED\n  Went for a weekday lunch. Ordered Mutton Biryani and Pomfret. Biryani was okay, but the Fish smelled and was dry. Also, as the crowd increased, the staff got impatient and served us Biryani despite its asking for extra time to finish the Fish. They were keen on getting us out, and getting the next customers in -- which is understandable, but shouldn't be shown like that.""), ('Rated 3.0', 'RATED\n  This is a newly opened outlet of thalappakatti in Trinity circle.. The place is quite small. But gets pretty crowded during lunch. The waiting time is a good half hour if you reach there after 1.30pm.\nThe service is quite fast and prompt.\nWe ordered lamb chops, where the mutton was well seasoned and tender, the kottu porotta was mushy and and tasted blank, we then ordered mutton and chicken boneless biriyani both tasted decently good but way too oily. There was always something missing taste wise,in all the dishes I had. The biriyani quantity is good enough to share with another person but not the starters.\nI felt that the food was overly priced.')]","[]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0

Right spice levels + good quality boneless meat + flavourful rice make it quite a good choice, a lot different from the ubiquitous Andhra biriyani.\nThey have some good side dishes as well, though most of them seem to be available only in the evenings.

We were asked to wait for 10 mins and trust me it was worth the wait. We sat down and the seats were comfortable. Although its a busy place but no one will bother you. Kudos to the staff for getting everything on time, you just need to ask them once. I ordered 2 chicken boneless biryani and it was good. It would be great to come here during the day and try out their thali once.'), ('Rated 2.0', ""RATED\n  Went for a weekday lunch. Ordered Mutton Biryani and Pomfret. Biryani was okay, but the Fish smelled and was dry. Also, as the crowd increased, the staff got impatient and served us Biryani despite its asking for extra time to finish the Fish. They were keen on getting us out, and getting the next customers in -- which is understandable, but shouldn't be shown like that.""), ('Rated 3.0', 'RATED\n  This is a newly opened outlet of thalappakatti in Trinity circle.. The place is quite small. But gets pretty crowded during lunch. The waiting time is a good half hour if you reach there after 1.30pm.\nThe service is quite fast and prompt.\nWe ordered lamb chops, where the mutton was well seasoned and tender, the kottu porotta was mushy and and tasted blank, we then ordered mutton and chicken boneless biriyani both tasted decently good but way too oily. There was always something missing taste wise,in all the dishes I had. The biriyani quantity is good enough to share with another person but not the starters.\nI felt that the food was overly priced.')]","[]",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
