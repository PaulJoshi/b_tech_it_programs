1,Phone is superb! It is smooth and does it work as per its processor and the given features. The look and feel of this model is having the Oneplus core Signature built value. Overall a nice phone.
2,"One of the best phones from OnePlus
Amazing camera 80w super fast charger definitely go for it"
3,I will say that I am happy with this phone when I saw the heating problem in the review I was worried but this is not my case. The camera is the best. saturation as well as naturally it does not smooth out the picture which is really good. It looks like a premium phone. One thing is the lack of earphone aux port. May be I bought the phone after a long time but I am someone who uses aux as I usually forget to charge with BT earphones.
4,"Very good processor and camera.
Look and feel is also premium"
5,"Great product,good photos and no lags even after adding many apps. Very fast charging. Smooth interface. Fast face recognition and good finger print access. after using for one week, no major heating issues even after ok installing 90+ apps. Works as expected. No major issues till first week of heavy apps usage not includiny any gaming."

Perfect for gaming
Amazing mobile
Outstanding look"
8,"It isvry gd phone and my first one plus mobile so it is very gd specially Display,smoothness and its camera i wil give 5/5"
9,It's working perfectly fine.. no heating problem. Good battery performance. Am happy!
10,Switched from Nord to Nord2t. Good camera and charging speed. Phone is very fast.
11,Hot and not good quality product
12,"Pleaseeeee don't buy this Phone at all..
Its totally wastage of Rs. 29K specially if you are Camera lover or thinking about to buy this for any photo or video purpose then it's a humble request for your sake..
1. Back camera is Normally good

2. Rear 50 MP camera is just only for name also you can't Zoom in when you are using 50 MP option.

3. Front camera is like VGA or 2 MP cheap camera.. its 32 MP but i think OnePlus has forgot to add 30 MP and just add a simple 2 MP front camera. I didn't saw this kind of cheap camera Quality.

4. OnePlus says Supervooc 80 Watts charger but this is also only for Name it is not any Supervooc power it's like any other fast charger

5. Battery backup is too much bad as it charges fast and battery also get drained fast..

I wanted to post review earlier but Amazon had blocked review option Today review option started so i am posting a genuine and personal review rest you can take a try if you think i am telling lies"

ÊI received this phone a week ago and writing after checking all spects, Below are the issues that I am facing with this phn
1 It is heating from 1st day
2 apps are not closing in one go, I have added a video for the same
3 Sometimes it gets really slow
4 step calculator is counting steps when I am driving or riding bike
5 There are other software related problems as well and it needs better update
I was a big fan of one plus brand but now I think they are running to launch new phones only and not looking into qualityof the product.. Not happy with product"
14,Purchased this for my brother. i was a oneplus 6T user earlier for a long time that was a amazing flagship device at that time & the same vibes i am getting again for this phone. Again it will be the flagship device of this budget range phone. Amazing phone everything is is just perfect. But camera I clicked some photos donÕt know why I didnÕt get that old 6T wala feeling. Although it has sony lens and all. Except that every thing is just perfect
15,The device has restarted like 10 times in last two days. Seems there is no option to clear entire cache at once. Not sure what's the root cause. Did factory reset as well but the restarting issue does not seem to go away
16,"Mobile is not up to mark it's heating and hanging too much .. functionality is not good .. camera quality also poor..

I will recommend not to buy .."
17,Best phone under 30k
18,It is a good product to pursue. Cost-effective product??
19,"Heating issue, battery draining but charging is super fast. Price should be around 22k."
20,"Please dont buy this particular model, it is heating with normal usage and battery is draining very fast, it has software issues as well.. better go for 8t or higher"

Overall Worth IT!"
22,"Using since 3 days no issue till now
Pros
Good camera
Night mode is also working well
Charging is super fast as mentioned in specs
Display is super

ÊMere khne se toh ispe pese invest Krna bekar hain camera quality main pixel zoom krne pe fatata hain not good mobile"
24,"Battery drain - Yes quicker
Battery Heat - yes
I took the phone to one + service centre they said it's common in all phones, it's not an issue itseems
Better go different brand
Many suggested one +
After long time I bought it
Really really really disappointed
Wasted my money
Due to out of station I couldn't return the phone else I would have seriously returned and said wrong item
One+ if ur reading this comment please take back all the Device and make it to perfection please because most of them are complaining about battery drain, heating"
25,"Don't know why thy relaunch this when Nord 2 was thr...thy stop selling Nord 2 suddenly.
Too much weight...looks like holding small brick in hand...you can't hold phone in hand more then ten min.
Camera is good but not excellent...not good at all in low light.
As campare to other pH in this range looks like paid more unnecessary.
Not expected from OnePlus
I would suggest don't buy just explore other option aswell."
26,"It works perfectly fine, screen touch finger print sensor is good, the only problem I feel is it has low volume in spear calls. Other than that all is ok."
27,Good product
28,The best oneplus mobile in this price segment affordable for all. Pretty much satisfied with the product as it can easily handle the work of a day or two!
29,Heating issue while charging. Hope one plus rectifies it with updates.. performance wise good.. Battery getting charged fully in around 35-40 minutes. Camera good..a little heavy weight
30,"ÊPhone is ok in 30k , initially it was heating alot but after the updates it is working fine. OxygenOs is working very smooth as it is my first one plus product.
Refresh rate is 90hz it's disappointing.
Back camera is good but selfie is a huge disappointment it feels like 15k phone.
Charging is super fast and battery also stands for a day easily . Some apps like asphalt are not working I dunno why, overall phone is ok but if you are expecting so much from phone like me so mightbe you will get disappointment."
31,"12GB 1+ is awesome phone, it's real fast and charger is just wow. Camera and display could have been better but not disappointing. Face camera it's real quick and accurate"
32,No earphone slot
33,"Best flagship camera compare with any good mobiles out there
superb quality night photos were best
Performace was buttery smooth with dimensity 1200 especially when gaming i play freefire,bgmi, codm

Battery is Excellent in one charge even after heavy usage it lasts for 8to 10 hour

Multitasking is awesome with expandable RAM

Must buy product in this price range"
34,Camera quality is not good. Battery drains too fast. In 4-5 hr battery drains completely. Will not prescribe to buy as this is not worth the ??. Sound quality is good though with fast charging but the rest is below average.
35,"I like the speed, touch response, battery and charging time."
36,"Loved the new style phone, packing was safe during the heavy raining times. The camera clarity is good front and rear it all depends on the right lights around u , at times early Mrng clicked pics yet was ok rest other time was perfect ?? also loved the audio and the phone quality of handling it was cool . Gaming spend around 2-3 hrs playing shooting game and it was seamless. Wowo great space with and nice new phone would say better bthan the initial one"
37,"Great Phone Best Quality of display, Camera and 5g quality.

Little bit heat found only at the time of first time charging, later not found.

Amazing 0 to 100% changed within / less than 30 min - 80w

Best Voice Clarity identified, unless if you are staying in forest or hill station, other wise great Phone.

Overall my experience is ?$´Û$´Û Awesome."
38,"the battery backup of this mobile phone is very poor , its drain too fast , i have to charge norde 2t 5g, two times per day.. also i didnt like the front camera much but the back camera was the osm ,
i will not suggest any one to buy it ... in that much price ... not worth it"
39,Phone is smooth with ram and storage...but camera is not that my good as expected.......charging is excellent 100% in 20 minutes
40,"It is very nice ,camara clarity is super."
41,"They Told You For Better Camera And Specifications, But Nothing Available As Per Given Details In Specifications.
Front Camera Very Poor,
This Phone Front Camera Is 32 MP, Not Beeter Than Oppo Reno 2f 16MP, That's Why My Last Phone Is Oppo, I'm Aware From Oppo Specifications. I'll Give Point -1/100"
42,"Its a good phone...only con is 90hz display....they should give 120hz display at this price point...... otherwise very good handset....and one more thing.
Please don't call it Oxygen os..its same as realme ui.... please try to be unique in Oxygen os 13 in future."
43,Battery is not good. Phone get hot in a while after using. Not satisfied with this product
44,This phone has serious heating issue and the service centre guys are not resolving it either

ÊOrderd very first day.... Good experience so far..
Pros:
screen is much soothing and features are exact as expected... Initially I was not satisfied with the cameras (But went deep dived into the features)... Now, my simple answer is ?????? and it will take hardly 35 mins to charge...

Cons:
Phone is bit heating
Camera design should be much more good (though it won't disappoint you!)

Verdict: people who are searching phone under 30k.. u can go ahead with this phone"
46,I am so happy with one plus Nord 2T. It's really good product for this price point. No heating issue. Performance is very good
47,"?? The refresh rate is just awesome
?? Camera is fabulous
?? Gaming is Super
?? 80 Watt charger very Quick charging
?? Display is soothing
?? Color is just wow.. nothing like before.

I love to use OnePlus Nord 2T ??"
48,Its an amazing phone and one of the best phones under 30k. The fast charging and the camera is superb. The response rate and display is the best
49,Please don't waste your money. Camera is looks like normal 10k range phone. Display quality is also very dull. I'm completely disappointed with this mobile
50,"Premium design, light weight and smooth functioning. Performance too good."
51,"Phone is good in all dimensions. However, the seller is misleading by showing MRP 33,999. The MRP of 8/128 is Rs. 28,999."
52,"After 3Days Using My Review Smooth & Speed Very Good Experience
Performance 5/5
Android 12.1 Os :5/5
Product Quality:5/5
Camera 5/4
Battery 5/4
Sound :5/4

53,"Bas 90 hz refresh rate se upar rehta to aur acha hota.. aur front camera me v imx 766 hona chahiye tha ya 612.
Baaki ab le liye hai to rakhna he hai.
Thik hai phone premium look h
Chalta v smooth h
Call confrence krne pr kuch 2-3 second k liye blank ho jata hai pta nhi kyu.
Call recording me sbko suna deta h ki record ho rhi h ye bakwas lga mujhe.
Aur kya btau. Screen guard lgawa lena pre apply wala jyda der chalega nhi.
Charger heat hota h bhut tez.
Phone v kavi kvi heat ho jata h .
Heavy usese k liye nhi hai.
Charging speed jaise batayi ja rhi hai waisi hai n mai ekdum low krke charge kiya to 35 minutes le liya.
Esko 25 -27 minutes se jyda nhi jana chahiye.
Mera 12 /256 varient h. Aur yahi Lena sahi hai kyuki 128 wala jaldi bhar jayega kyuki 5-6 mb me ek pic ati h. Aur system 25 gb rehta he hai aur apne apps mila kr 40 gb aise he ho jayega aur game wagera koi le liye to 60 gb tak easily chala jayega.
Baaki sab thik hai use ho rha hai OS 15 v milta to acha rehta but company de nhi rhi.
Bad news for us."
54,"One of the best flagship phone under 28000 range , best camera, best processor , best battery, and charge within 30 mins. Fingerprint sensor working smoothly and its having amoled display. Best for gaming and heavy use day to day."
55,Its nt giving the clear pic compare to Nord 2 also. Not sure why nord 2 has better front camera than nord 2t even the specs are similar.
56,Ultimate Fantastic Experience with excellent battery life
57,"Awesome phone, decent battery, Amazing Display. Camera quality is very clear. Used my Boat headphones and sound is good too. quite light in weight. works brilliantly for gaming."
58,"So far I found the phone to be really good. Charging is super fast, phone is smooth & fast, camera is great, speakers gives a good output too. I also like the back finish. Will update further if I find some issues."
59,"The first thing is it's a very gud balanced mobile.
1. Good cameras, best display 90hz (there's no
difference btw 90hz and 120hz,it's a trick).
2. Battery will easily sufficient for 1 day and fast
charging was amazing,takes roughly 20-25
mins
3.dimensity 1300 it's good in daily usable apps,
very good ram management.
4. In-display fingerprint sensor was very fast.
5. Especially the Oxygen OS was still interesting
and many new features were included.
6. Android 12 and OS 12.1 was impressive no
blotware and clean UI.
7. Stereo speakers was rocking, loudest, balance
8. Design was attractive, and it's absolutely light
weight, in hand feel was classy and premium.
9. Many 5g bands, NFC, 4g+, very good UI.

And coming to disappointments
1. If your prior use is gamming this mobile was
not preferable there are other mobiles for
that like iqoo...etc
2. Daily 1-2 hrs gamming was good but some
heating we can see like 40*c.
3. At this price we expect snapdragon but this is
also good.

Finally, if u love OnePlus brand, don't believe any reviews. Go for ONEPLUS NORD 2T 5g."
60,"ÊAfter update not heating much??I love the camera.speakers are too loud and crispy ??,super charging support,decent bgmi performance.if you don't care about brand value go for iqoo Neo 6 &poco f4.oneplus nord 2t is a all rounder phone with higher brand value in the market"
